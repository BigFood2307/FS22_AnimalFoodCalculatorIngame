# Animal Food Calculator (Mod)

Adds an estimate for daily and yearly food requirement to the animal screen (Right under the current fill level)

## Daily Food Requirement
This is the amount of Food required for the current day. If you have more days per month, this value is lower, since all food requirements in FS are set per month.
The mod already calculates that for you!

## Yearly Food Requirement
This is an estimate for a 12 month period. Since animals need more food as they grow up, this will not necessarily be 12 x daysPerMonth x dailyFoodRequirement.
Instead the mod simulates the whole year and calculates the requirement for each month, with cows growing up.
New births are not included in this estimate.
